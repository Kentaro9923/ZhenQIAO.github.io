Welcome to my Website!ðŸ˜Š 

My name is Zhen QIAO (ä¹”ç¥¯). I'm a Ph.D. student from [Engineering Systems and Design Pillar(ESD)](https://esd.sutd.edu.sg/), [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/).  I obtained my master's degree in Engineering of Information, Production and Design at [Waseda University, Japan](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Fujimura Shigeru](https://www.waseda.jp/fsci/gips/other-en/2015/09/08/2172/). Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree with Distinction in Industrial Optimisation (Industrial and Applied Mathematics) from [Curtin University, Australia](https://www.curtin.edu.au) and bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from [Yanshan University, P.R.China](https://english.ysu.edu.cn/index.htm).

My research interests are broadly in optimization, machine learning, and data-driven decision making like prescriptive analysis. I enjoy thinking about analyzing the existing "Learn to optimize" algorithm under data imbalance, and bulding new ways to solve decision-making problems (usually modeled with optimization). Besides, I am also interested in recent trending topics like casual inference in experiment design.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Karthyek Murthy](https://sites.google.com/site/karthyekswebpage/) of Risk analytics and Robust Optmization Lab from [ESD](https://esd.sutd.edu.sg/), [SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/)
